Realistic digital painting. Rural Yakutia, mid-20th century (zimnik — a winter homestead). A wooden house and a new cowshed attached to the house; the entrance to the cowshed is behind the Russian stove. Inside the house, on the shestok — the ledge in front of the stove’s firebox — traditional Yakut winter boots (torboza, made of treated hide) are drying. The boots are placed there after the firewood has already burned down. Inside the boots are visible pieces of charcoal, ash, grain, and pieces of flatbread. Flatbread is usually stored on a wall shelf in the house. In the morning, the family examines whose boots contain the most items — a kind of game and amusement for the children during the long, gray winter days. The scene carries an atmosphere of a supernatural, mysterious presence.
