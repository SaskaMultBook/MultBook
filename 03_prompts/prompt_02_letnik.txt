Реалистичная цифровая живопись. Сельская Якутия середины XX века, летник — летний участок с Realistic digital painting. Rural Yakutia, mid-20th century; letnik — a summer site with temporary buildings, a dwelling house, and a three-rail wooden fence (traditional fence), along with a large state farm cowshed. While the mother was working in the cowshed (hoton in Yakut) together with others, I, holding my little sister in my arms and standing with another girl who lived with us, was looking out the window. Nearby, by the fence, the chairman’s horse was grazing. Suddenly, above the horse, the head of an old woman appeared, wearing a traditional scarf tied in the old style (povoynik), without a body. The head floated in the air for a long time. Seeing this, the children fell unconscious in horror and became ill. The parents laid them on the bed and returned to work. In the evening, the parents themselves saw, by the window, a copper-red figure with a huge face and elongated eyes. From that moment, the boy again fell into unconsciousness; all night he trembled and twitched, but in the morning he suddenly recovered and ran off as if nothing had happened. The atmosphere is anxious, supernatural, mystical; a Yakut village in the mid-1960s.
