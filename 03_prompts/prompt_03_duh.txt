Realistic digital painting. Rural Yakutia, mid-20th century. Children go to pick strawberries. The berry-rich place is enclosed by old fences made of three wooden rails. On the fence hangs strange and frightening clothing. Frightened, the children run home. Near their house stands the chairman’s house. There lives a twenty-year-old, severely ill young man; he sometimes gets up from bed and speaks with the boy’s mother. One day he tells them that he has found a place rich in strawberries. Indeed, for two days the children pick berries, sing, play, and enjoy themselves. But suddenly, one of the girls falls ill with seizures — she develops meryachenie, an ethnospecific psychological disorder characteristic of the peoples of Eastern Siberia. She raves and sings strange songs. The children are blamed: people say they angered the spirit of that place. After this, when they visit the site, the children never sing or speak loudly — they behave like thieves. Elders tell how the spirit of the place once appeared to a woman searching for her cows: on the hill a woman began to sing with an extraordinarily beautiful voice. They say it was the spirit of that locality. The atmosphere is mystical, anxious, and folktale-like. It conveys the belief that every old settlement site has its own guardian spirit, and if angered — frightening things can appear. Style: realism, digital painting.
