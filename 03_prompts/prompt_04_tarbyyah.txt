Realistic digital painting. Rural Yakutia, 1930s. At the site of a horse farm stand numerous buildings — log houses built in the Russian style with small windows, and large stables. Nearby there is also a cattle farm. A boy and his sister are tying the cows in the stall inside a nearby cowshed (hoton). Suddenly, in the calves’ pen, they see a very pale, ginger-haired, completely naked little boy, as if just born. He begins to rise from the manger, but with a heavy groan lies back down. The children run away in terror. The next day, all the calves fall ill, apparently with bronchopneumonia. The atmosphere is anxious, with the feeling of an encounter with a spirit — mystical and terrifying.
